# Layer QuickStart for Android

**Example code for integrating [LayerKit](https://layer.com/).**

QuickStart is a sample application highlighting how to integrate LayerKit, the Android SDK for the Layer communications platform. It presents a very simple example of a chat app using Layer.

## Requirements

The QuickStart application requires Android Studio and the Layer SDK. Dependencies are managed via [Maven](https://developer.layer.com/docs/quick-start/android) to simplify installation.

## Usage

1. Clone the project from Github: `$ git clone https://github.com/layerhq/quick-start-android.git`
2. Open the workspace in Android Studio
3. Replace LAYER_APP_ID in MainActivity.java (line 11) with your App ID. Your App ID can be found in the dashboard under the "Keys" section.  If you skip this step you will get an error on app launch.
4. (Optional) Replace GCM_ID with your own Google Cloud Messaging ID (instructions can be found here: https://developer.layer.com/docs/guides#push-notification)
5. Build and run the QuickStart application on an Emulator and a physical Device to start a 1:1 conversation between them.

## Highlights

* Demonstrates how to implement authentication, typing indicators, and metadata
* Provides a reference implementation for driving Message UI

## Configuration

In order to populate the sample app with content, you must configure the following variable inside Constants.h:

* `LAYER_APP_ID`: The Layer application identifier for you application.

The authentication process requires that you provide a sandbox app identifier that has been configured to use the Layer Identity Provider.

## Credits

QuickStart was crafted in San Francisco by Neil Mehta during his work on [Layer](http://layer.com). At Layer, we are building the Communications Layer for the Internet. We value, support, and create works of Open Source engineering excellence.
